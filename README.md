Bitcoin, one of the most volatile and popular cryptocurrencies, has attracted significant attention in financial markets. Predicting Bitcoin prices is crucial for investors and traders to make informed decisions and mitigate risks. Time series forecasting is a powerful technique for analyzing historical data to predict future values. In this project, we demonstrate how to apply a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to forecast future Bitcoin prices using historical data.
